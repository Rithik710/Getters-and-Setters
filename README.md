# Getters-and-Setters
just suppose a variable is made private in a class. it meanss only members of that class can access to it right.
#eg => private : int x;
and then we make a function => int getValue() { return x ; } 
#what will happen, getValue() have access to x and hence it can return it, similarly we can edit this value also by a setValue() .
